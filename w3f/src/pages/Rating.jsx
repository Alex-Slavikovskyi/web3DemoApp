            Below youâ€™ll find the web3flows ratings breakdown for utility,
            usability, and visual design. These ratings are applied by our team
            of researchers.

            These three metrics are combined to form the overall rating for each
            score with the following weighting: utility (40%), usability (40%),
            visual design (20%). This weighting has been chosen to reflect the
            greater importance of utility and usability over visual design.
